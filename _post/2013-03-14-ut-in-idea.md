# Run Grails Unit Test in intellij idea

Edit Configuration and put the following in the command line:

```
test-app unit:spock XXXService -echoOut
```

If we use IDEA unit test runner, the grails environment will not be initialized. For example, the log will not be ready to use. So you may got the following exception:

```
groovy.lang.MissingPropertyException: No such property: log for class: grails.buildtestdata.BuildTestDataService
```
