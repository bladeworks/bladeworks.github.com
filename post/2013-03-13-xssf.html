        <title>Parse SXSSF generated excel file with XSSF event-based API</title>
    </head>

<xmp theme="simplex" style="display:none;">
Since POI 3.8-beta3, a low-memory footprint SXSSF API built on top of XSSF was provided. Its advantage is writing large spreadsheets. SXSSF achives its low memory footprint by limiting access to the rows that are within a sliding window. So it's only used for writing excel file.

XSSF provide a event-based model which is very useful while reading large spreadsheets. An example was provided in the official source code which you can find it [here](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk/src/examples/src/org/apache/poi/xssf/eventusermodel/XLSX2CSV.java).

However, you can't use the example code to parse a file generated by SXSSF API. The reason is that the file generated by SXSSF doesn't use shared string. You can simply change the generated file's extension to **zip** and extract it. Find some files like Sheet1.xml and you will find the secret.
